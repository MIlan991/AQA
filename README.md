Hello!
For this assignment I have used the following: Maven as a build automation tool; Selenium to automate the
browser; JUnit for assertions; and Java as a programming language. Chrome web driver is implemented for
this purpose.
Tests have been written in 3 scenarios. “Signup”, “Login” and “E2E” tests.
For “Sign Up” tests elements and methods have been written in SignUpPage.java file. Test Cases have been
written in TestSignUp.java file. Every test case can ran independently, using right click/Run As/1 Unit Test
This is a test with a few negative and one positive cases.
For “Log In” tests elements and methods have been written in LogInPage.java file. Test Cases have been
written in TestLogIn.java file. Every test case can ran independently, using right click/Run As/1 Unit Test
This is a test with a few negative and one positive cases.
For “E2E” test, elements and methods have been written in DashboardPage.java and CheckoutPage.java. Test
Cases have been written in TestDashboard.java file. Those tests can not be run independently. They need to
be run all at once. This test scenario shows us how user is adding items to the cart, deleting them, manipulate
with amount, finalising the purchase, and finally log out.
